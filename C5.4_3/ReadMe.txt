This sample should behave exactly the same as C5.4_2.
The difference is I am trying to using the PL011 drvier from TF-M repo.

The TF-M PL011 driver is from:
https://github.com/TrustedFirmware-M/trusted-firmware-m/tree/main/platform/ext/target/arm/drivers/usart/pl011

My purpose is to less the burden of device driver development and focus on OS itself.
